Exercise 1: Rock, Paper, or Scissors - functions  
Exercise 2: Whale Talk - Loops  
  
There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:   
There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.  
The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.  
  
Exercise 3: MealMaker - objects  
Use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu.  
We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!
